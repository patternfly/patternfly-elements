"@patternfly/elements": major

PatternFly Elements 2.0 is a major rewrite of the project.
It brings PFE in-line with PatternFly React in terms of design specs
and modernizes the codebase with [Lit][lit] and [TypeScript][ts]. It adds a 
versatile set of tools for managing and building elements, and focuses more on 
cutting-edge web technologies like [form-associated custom elements][FACE] and 
[CSS shadow parts][css-shadow].

### Breaking Changes
- ðŸ”¥ Migrated elements to [Lit][lit]: initial render made [asynchronous][async].
  If your code assumes that shadow DOM is ready once the element is constructed,
  ensure you first `await element.updateComplete`
- Reimplemented elements in line with [PFv4][PFv4] design specs
- Combined all elements into a single package: `@patternfly/elements`
- Renamed all element prefixes from `pfe-` to `pf-`.
  ```html
  <!-- BEFORE: -->
  <pfe-button>Cancel</pfe-button>
  <!-- AFTER: -->
  <pf-button>Ok</pf-button>
  ```
