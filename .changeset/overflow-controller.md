`OverflowController`:
  - Added window resize event listener to recalculate overflow, due to removal of `BaseTabs` classes.
  - Fixed bug where dynamic tab creation would not trigger recalculation of overflow.

Please review the [Tabs 2.4 to 3.0 migration guide](https://patternflyelements.org/migration/3.0/tabs) for more 
information.
