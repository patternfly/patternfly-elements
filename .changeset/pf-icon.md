âœ¨ Added `<pf-icon>` and removed `<pf-icon>`. Icon now closely follows the 
PatternFly design spec.

Icon now ships with the entire free fontawesome collection as well as the 
patternfly icon set.

```html
<pf-icon icon="award" aria-label="Awards"></pf-icon>
```

### Breaking Changes
- ðŸ’± icon names are no longer prefixed by their set. use the `set` attribute 
  instead.
  ```html
  <!-- BEFORE -->
  <pfe-icon icon="patternfly-ansible"></pfe-icon>
  <!-- AFTER -->
  <pf-icon set="patternfly" icon="ansible"></pf-icon>
  ```

There are more changes than this, including breaking changes. Read the
