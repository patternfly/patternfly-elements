✨ Added `<pf-hint>` component

A **hint** is in-app messaging that provides a one-step reminder, explanation, 
or call to action for a page or modal. Hints provide information about an 
interaction or prerequisite step that might not be immediately obvious to the 
user.

```html
<pf-hint>
  Welcome to the new documentation experience.
  <a href="#">Learn more about the improved features</a>.
</pf-hint>
```
