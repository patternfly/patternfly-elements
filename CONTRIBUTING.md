## Submitting an Issue

### Bug Reporting

Here are a few helpful tips when reporting a bug:

- To report a bug, please use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).
- Make sure what you are describing is a bug and not a feature request. Is this how it was originally designed to work?
- Screenshots are very helpful in diagnosing bugs; please include them whenever possible.
- Check the console for errors and [copy or snapshot the output](https://zapier.com/help/troubleshoot/behavior/view-and-save-your-browser-console-logs).  Please document this in your issue.


### Feature Requests

If you have a feature that you think would be a great addition to the project:

- Check the issue queue for key words relating the issue. Try searching on the [feature label](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-elements/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afeature).  If an issue already exists, please add your thoughts to the discussion.
- Take a peek at our [pull requests](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-elements/pulls) to see what we're currently working on.

To suggest a feature use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

## Submitting a pull request

1. Check the [issue queue](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-elements/issues).  If your pull request does not map to an issue in the queue, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-elements/issues).
2. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository (see the Quick start in the [README][README.md])
3. Create a new branch.  Please use the [conventional commit](cc) formatting for the branch name.
    git checkout -b feat-my-branch-name
4. Make your change, [add tests](https://patternfly.github.io/patternfly-elements/develop/step-3/), and make sure the automated testing passes.
5. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].  Be sure to select from the available PR templates.


Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Review the documentation.
- Follow the style/format of the existing code.
- Write tests for your changes.
- Keep your change as small and focused as possible; if there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Be responsive during code review, as much as possible.
