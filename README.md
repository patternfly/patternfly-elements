[PatternFly Elements][pfe-home] is a work-in-progress collection of flexible and lightweight Web Components based on the Unified Design Kit. The repo also includes a generator to build new components. PatternFly Elements are:

- **Lightweight**: small file size, minimal boilerplate, no "framework-like" features.
- **Universal**: write once, use everywhere. PatternFly Elements work in React, Vue, Angular, vanilla JS, anywhere HTML elements are used.
- **Themable**: Make overrides as needed via attributes or CSS variables

The result of these principles is that you can plug one set of components into a wide variety of applications; bringing UX consistency and developer familiarity to any web project.

A generator is included for creating web components that meet these goals.

## Quick start
```
git clone git@github.com:patternfly/patternfly-elements.git
cd patternfly-elements
npm ci # install dependencies.
npm run dev # spin up a local dev server
```

### Additional dependencies

#### Hub

If you will be doing any release work, it is recommended that you install Hub.

To install on a MacOS: `brew install hub`.

For other systems, please see documentation:
    - [Hub](https://hub.github.com/)

_Note: You will need to use [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v12 or higher._

#### nvm

Building PatternFly Elements requires specific versions of Node.js.  To automate usage of the correct version, it is recommended that contributors install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#readme) as well an automatic version switcher like [avn](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn) or [shell-specific nvm integration](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration).  With those installed, your terminal will automatically switch to the correct Node.js version when you `cd` into the PatternFly Elements repository.

## Command Line Helper Scripts
Many commands have an optional argument of space-separated component name(s), if left off it will assume it should run on all components. These should run from the project root.
