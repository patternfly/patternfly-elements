This week we are pleased to announce the availability of PatternFly Elements 
3.0. This includes the release of our three main packages

- [`@patternfly/elements@3.0.0`][pfe3], our web component library implementing 
  PatternFly design
- [`@patternfly/pfe-core@3.0.0`][core3], utilities for web component authors,
  used in <abbr title="PatternFly Elements">PFE</abbr> and [<abbr title="Red Hat 
  Design System">RHDS</abbr>][rhds]
- [`@patternfly/pfe-tools@2.0.0`][tools2], utilities for web component library 
  maintainers, e.g. dev server configuration, unit test helpers, etc.

These releases include commits from Anuj Singla, Benny Powers, Brian Ferry, 
Gautam Krishna, Guy Bedford, Ivana Rodriguez, Luke Dary, Mark Caron, Michael 
Potter, Nikki Massaro, and Steven Spriggs. Thank you for your 
contributions!

## Accessibility

A lot of deep thought, careful testing, and hard work went into accessibility in 
this release. In particular, the leadership of our Principal Engineer for 
Accessibility Nikki Massaro and our Producer for Accessibility Greg Gibson were 
critical to designing elements which serve all of our customers.

### Roving Tabindex

One of the key insights in this release cycle was that when it comes to creating 
accessible controls, there is often more than one way to achieve sufficient 
results. We relied heavily on Nikki Massaro's `RovingTabindexController` 
(<abbr>RTIC</abbr>) when developing new elements like `<pf-select>` as well as 
when updating existing elements like `<pf-tabs>`. We ship controllers like RTIC 
in our pfe-core package. Controllers are bits of shared functionality which can 
plug in to any element and provide features like accessibility patterns or 
positioning floating elements.

This release revises <abbr>RTIC</abbr>'s developer ergonomics, making it useful 
even in framework components like React, not just in web components. The roving 
tabindex pattern allows end users to skip over complex controls like listboxes 
or tab groups when navigating a page by keyboard. The user only has to "tab 
into" the complex control once, and they can "tab out" immediately if they wish 
to continue down the page. If they want to navigate within the complex control, 
they can do so using the arrow keys.

### Cross-root <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr>

One of the major challenges faced during this release cycle was in adapting 
complex components and design patterns to the use of Shadow DOM and 
Form-Associated Custom Elements. As of this writing, there is yet no 
comprehensive cross-browser method for associating an element in one root (i.e. 
the main document) with an element in another root (i.e. a shadow root). An 
example of where this matters is in the case of dropdowns. In order to assistive 
technology to correctly announce the type, state, and availability of dropdown 
controls, the browser's internal accessibility tree must associate the button 
which toggles the dropdown menu open and closed with the listbox element that 
contains the dropdown actions.

In the case of dropdown, we wanted to offer our users the ability to slot in a 
custom toggle element to the dropdown control, but if we did so, then the menu 
(normally located within the shadow root of the dropdown) could not effectively 
be associated with the toggle. Our solution in that case was to require users 
who customize the toggle to also slot in a menu element, so that they both live 
in the same root.

We eagerly await the specification and implementation of cross-root <abbr 
  title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">ARIA</abbr> in web browsers, and 
our engineers continue to participate in the specification efforts at the Web 
Compoonents Community Group.

### The importance of manual testing

In a perfect world, browser vendors would implement accessibility specs 
immediately, completely, and uniformly; and assistive technology vendors would 
implement direct translations of the browser's internal accessibility tree to 
the end user. Of course, we don't live in such a world. During the development 
process, we rely on the browser's accessibility developer tools to understand 
how our complex controls appear to <abbr>AT</abbr>, and we write the majority of 
our unit tests as assertions against that tree ("When I click the toggle, expect 
the listbox to appear next to it in the tree").

We've seen again and again that just because something looks good to the 
developer when they inspect the AX tree doesn't mean that all users will be able 
to use it. We were fortunate to have the time, care, and expert testing skills 
of our Accessibility Producer Greg Gibson during this development cycle. 
Developers often ask us how to automate accessibility testing. Our answer is 
always that automation can only get you so far. Cross-browser, cross-platform, 
manual testing is essential to ensure the widest reach for your products.

## New Elements

PatternFly Elements 3.0 continues the work started in 2.0 to bring the design 
and user experience into line with the PatternFly React v4 library. Behind the 
scenes we also expended quite a lot of effort to align our Elements internal 
implementations and external apis more closely with the pattern fly react 
library. We are looking forward to continuing this work towards pattern fly for 
both in terms of implementing components that we don't have yet as well as 
closing the future parity gaps and ensuring greater compatibility with the 
existing pattern fly library.

We've added several elements to our collection in this release:

- `<pf-back-to-top>` - A shortcut that allows users to quickly navigate to the 
top of a lengthy content page.
- `<pf-background-image>` - Allows users to place an image in the background of 
your page or area of a page.
- `<pf-chip>` and `<pf-chip-group>` - Used to communicate a value or a set of 
attribute-value pairs within workflows that involve filtering a set of objects.
- `<pf-dropdown>` - Presents a menu of actions or links in a constrained space 
that will trigger a process or navigate to a new location.
- `<pf-select>` - Enables users to select one or more items from a list.
- `<pf-text-area>` - Used for entering a paragraph of text that is longer than 
one line.

Select and dropdown in particular, because of their accessibility requirements, 
were a major effort this release.

### New Features

We also added features and made changes to elements released in previous 
versions:

- `<pf-text-input>` gets `helper-text`, `error-text`, and `validate-on` 
attributes, and now supports the native `pattern` and `placeholder` attributes.
- `<pf-button>` now acts itself as a button, and doesn't contain a `<button>` 
element in its shadow root.
- `<pf-modal>` no longer has a `width` attribute, so use the `variant` attribute 
instead.
- `<pf-switch>` uses a slightly different markup for its labels, improving 
accessibility.

### Controllers and Decorators

The Core and Tools packages received major changes as well. Core no longer 
recommends the `@cascades` decorator, which was used to set a given attribute on 
a set of known, named child elements. Instead, we provide some helpers for using 
the Context Protocol via Lit's `@provide` and `@consume` decorators. We made the 
constructors for `InternalsController` private, in order to prevent situations 
in which the user tries to create more than one `ElementInternals` object for a 
given element (which the browser will not allow).

Steven Spriggs worked on the new `TabsAriaController`, which simplifies the 
process of writings tab group components. Brian Ferry added an `isEmpty` method 
to `SlotController`, which developers can use e.g. to hide part of an element 
when it has no slotted content.

### Tools

Our new version of the PFE dev server no longer uses the node-resolution 
algorithm, instead it generates an import map to your components. We've made it 
easier to share CSS between different element's shadow roots using the `lit-css` 
and `typescript-transformer-lit-css` packages. Our react wrapper generator 
should now work for more projects, as well.
