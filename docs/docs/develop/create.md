{% band header="The PatternFly Element Generator" %}
  Use the PatternFly Element generator to start the scaffolding process. From the root directory of the PatternFly Elements  repository, run the following command.

  ```bash
  npm run new
  ```

  The generator will ask you a series of questions to set up your project.

  1.  Your element name:
      - Your element's name should be lowercase and needs to contain at least one hyphen. For rules on naming custom elements, refer to the W3C [Custom Elements Working Draft](https://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/#valid-custom-element-name).
      - PatternFly Elements prefixes elements with `pfe-`. However, prefix your elements with whatever fits your project.
      - As an example, we'll create `pfe-cool-element`.

  1. The [NPM scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scope) for the package. For example, patternfly elements packages like `@patternfly/pfe-core` are published under the `patternfly` scope.

  1. A number of questions about the npm package, including the author's name and email, etc.

  After answering the questions, your new component will be created and bootstrapped in the repository.

  Once that's done, switch directories to the element you just created. We'll `cd` into the `pfe-cool-element` directory.

  ```bash
  cd elements/pfe-cool-element
  ```

  Open your code editor to view the structure of the element.
  The element's source files are located directly in it's package root, in our case:
    - `pfe-cool-element.ts` - The element class declaration
    - `pfe-cool-element.scss` - The element's SASS style module

  These two files are the most important as they contain the actual element definition.
  In addition, there are a number of config files. Do not edit these files unless you know what you're doing.
    - `custom-elements-manifest.config.js` - Configuration for the custom-elements-manifest analyzer.
    - `custom-elements.json` - A manifest of your package's JS exports and custom elements.
    - `package.json` - NPM package configuration and scripts
    - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration for your monorepo.

  For now, your `custom-elements.json` file is empty. If you'd like to generate content for it, run the `analyze` script in your element's workspace:

  ```bash
  npm run analyze -w @patternfly/pfe-cool-element
  ```

  This happens automatically when you build or publish your elements, so don't worry about forgetting to run it.

  The `demo` directory contains an HTML partial that you can edit to provide an interactive demo of your element.

  The `test` directory contains unit test files for your elemen.
