{% band header="Using PatternFly Elements in your React app" %}
We have created React wrapper for each web component by using [@lit/react](https://github.com/lit/lit/tree/main/packages/react#litreact) library. This library helps us to create the React wrapper for web components and we can use it same as React components. Please check this [example](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/pfe-react-wrappers-3g6x6r?file=%2Fpackage.json%3A1%2C1) for more details. If you are more interested in how we are doing in patternfly element library. Please check this [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/gen-wrapper-react).

‚ÄúUsing PatternFly Elements in your React App‚Äù is broken down into four sections:

- Initial setup
- Adding PatternFly Elements
- Interacting with our web components API
- Adding icing on the cake

Each section will show you exactly what you need to do with code snippets and an accompanying CodeSandbox that you can edit or fork.
{% endband %}

{% band header="Initial setup" %}
Create a new React project with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) by running this command

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

This command will ask you to provide project name, framework and variant.

{% endband %}

{% band header="Adding PatternFly Elements" %}
With the setup complete, You need to install @lit-labs/react and @patternfly/elements library.

```bash
npm install @lit-labs/react @patternfly/elements
```

In our `App.tsx` file in the `/src/` directory, let‚Äôs import Button component.

```js
import { useState } from "react";
import { Button } from "@patternfly/elements/react/pf-button/pf-button.js";
import { Card } from "@patternfly/elements/react/pf-card/pf-card.js";
import "./App.css";
```

Let‚Äôs use Button and Card component in the `App` function in the `App.tsx` file to see that our Card and Button is working.

```js
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="card">
      <Card id="card" rounded>
        <h1 slot="header">React + PatternFly Elements</h1>
        <div>count is {count}</div>
        <Button slot="footer" onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>
          Increment
        </Button>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Below is the accompanying CodeSandbox to see that our initial setup is correct and that we‚Äôve successfully added our web components to our app.

{% endband %}

{% band %}
Now that we have a card and a call-to-action, let‚Äôs add an accordion (pf-accordion) to our app to spice things up a bit.
If we were building this app locally, we‚Äôd install our dependencies from npm using yarn.

```bash
yarn add @patternfly/elements
```

If you‚Äôre using CodeSandbox, just search for ‚Äú@patternfly/elements‚Äù.

After installing pf-accordion, add the markup to the `App` function in the `index.js` file.

```html
<pf-accordion>
  <pf-accordion-header>
    <h3>Why do wizards need money if they could just create it?</h3>
  </pf-accordion-header>
  <pf-accordion-panel>
    <p>
      There is legislation that decides what you can conjure and what you can
      not. Because things that you conjure out of thin air will not last, it is
      illegal in the wizarding world.
    </p>
  </pf-accordion-panel>
  <pf-accordion-header>
    <h3>Why doesn't Harry have a portrait of his parents?</h3>
  </pf-accordion-header>
  <pf-accordion-panel>
    <p>
      <a href="#">The characters in the portraits</a> are not actually ghosts.
      They mainly are there just to repeat common phrases or serve as a general
      <a href="foobarbaz.com">representation of the individual</a> they depict.
      A portrait of his parents would not be of much help to Harry.
    </p>
  </pf-accordion-panel>
  <pf-accordion-header>
    <h3>
      Why is Harry considered a half-blood if both of his parents could use
      magic?
    </h3>
  </pf-accordion-header>
  <pf-accordion-panel>
    <p>
      Because Harry's grandparents were not able to do magic. This is generally
      frowned upon by those who consider themselves pure, such as the Malfoy's
      or other antagonists.
    </p>
  </pf-accordion-panel>
  <pf-accordion-header>
    <h3>Is Hogwarts the only wizarding school?</h3>
  </pf-accordion-header>
  <pf-accordion-panel>
    <p>
      No! It has been revealed that there are actually 11 long established and
      prestigious schools around the globe. These include Castelobruxo in the
      rainforest of Brazil, Durmstrang Institute (whereas nobody is certain of
      it‚Äôs whereabouts), and Ilvermorny, right here in the United States.
    </p>
  </pf-accordion-panel>
  <pf-accordion-header>
    <h3>Where do the main characters work as adults?</h3>
  </pf-accordion-header>
  <pf-accordion-panel>
    <p>
      Harry and Hermione are at the Ministry: he ends up leading the Auror
      department. Ron helps George at the joke shop and does very well. Ginny
      becomes a professional Quidditch player and then sportswriter for the
      Daily Prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/collection/characters" target="blank"
        >Read more about the characters</a
      >
    </p>
  </pf-accordion-panel>
</pf-accordion>
```

And we have to import pf-accordion in `index.js`.

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import "@patternfly/elements/pf-card/pf-card.js";
import "@patternfly/elements/pf-accordion/pf-accordion.js";

import "./styles.css";
```

Below is the accompanying CodeSandbox for adding pf-accordion to our app.

{% endband %}

{% band header="Interacting with our web components API" %}
After adding our accordion, let‚Äôs say that we‚Äôd like to have the first panel of the accordion
open up after the page loads. To work with the accordion, there are a few things that we need to
hook up.

> üëâ **Note**: React 18@experimental provides support for HTML, so the `useEffect`/`useRef`
> workaround is no longer needed for property setting and event listeners

First, let‚Äôs import `useRef` and `useEffect`.

```js
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
```

Now let‚Äôs create a React Ref so we can work with the pf-accordion DOM API. To learn more about
Refs and the DOM in React,
[check out their documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html). We‚Äôll start by
creating a new ref inside our `App` function.

```js
const accordion = useRef();
```

We'll add a `useEffect` callback and call the `toggle` method on the ref's current element
(our `<pf-accordion>`), so we can open the first panel of the accordion when the page loads.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  accordion.current.toggle(0);
});
```

Next, let‚Äôs add all of our markup from the `App` function we had previously to our `return` method.
We‚Äôll also want to add a ref attribute to the opening tag of pf-accordion and set it equal to `{accordion}`.

```js
function App() {
  const accordion = useRef();

  useEffect(() => {
    accordion.current.toggle(0);
  });

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>PatternFly Elements with React</h1>
      <section>
        <pf-card rounded>
          <img
            alt="From https://picsum.photos/"
            src="https://picsum.photos/id/1019/300/200"
          />
          <p>
            This is the light pf-card and <a href="#">a link</a>.

Now, when the page loads, the accordion will have the first panel opened. Below is the accompanying CodeSandbox.

I realize that may have been a lot. So let‚Äôs recap what we did.

1. Initial Setup: Added the web component polyfills
2. Adding PatternFly Elements (web components): Added the following web components as dependencies in our app: pf-card, and pf-accordion
3. Adding PatternFly Elements (web components): Imported the web components into our `index.js` file
4. Adding PatternFly Elements (web components): Added the markup for our components in `index.js`
5. Interacting with our web components API: Created a reference to the accordion so we could open the first panel after the page loads
   {% endband %}

{% band header="Wrap up" %}
So there you have it. We‚Äôve added web components to our React app and gained the benefits of using portable, pre-made components that can also be used in other frameworks like Angular and Vue. If your app is written in Angular or Vue, check out our other two posts: ‚ÄúUsing PatternFly Elements in your Angular App‚Äù and ‚ÄúUsing PatternFly Elements in your Vue App.‚Äù
