{% band header="Using PatternFly Elements in your React app" %}
  To get web components to work with React it‚Äôs pretty easy and straightforward. If you‚Äôd like to follow along,
  go ahead and [create a new React CodeSandbox on codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/new).
  The React sandbox uses [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to scaffold an app and you can
  view your changes in real-time right in the web app. With CodeSandbox, you can also add any npm dependency with
  just a few button clicks. If you want to run this app locally, you can
  [clone the repository on 
  GitHub](https://github.com/kylebuch8/patternfly-elements-with-react).

  ‚ÄúUsing PatternFly Elements in your React App‚Äù is broken down into four sections:
  - Initial setup
  - Adding PatternFly Elements
  - Interacting with our web components API
  - Adding icing on the cake

  Each section will show you exactly what you need to do with code snippets and an accompanying CodeSandbox that you can edit or fork.
{% endband %}

{% band header="Initial setup" %}
  Import React and ReactDOM at the top of the `index.js` file in the `/src/` directory.

  ```js
  import React from 'react';
  import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
  ```
{% endband %}

{% band header="Adding PatternFly Elements" %}
  With the setup complete, let‚Äôs add a couple of PatternFly Elements web components to our application to make sure everything is hooked up properly.
  We‚Äôre going to add a card ([pf-card](/components/card)).
  Later, we‚Äôll add an accordion ([pf-accordion](/components/accordion)) and some CSS to help with our layout ([pf-layouts](/layout)).

  Once again, if we were building this app locally, we‚Äôd install our dependencies from npm using yarn.

  ```bash
  yarn add @patternfly/elements
  ```
  But if you‚Äôre using CodeSandbox, just search for "@patternfly/pf-card"

  In our `index.js` file in the `/src/` directory, let‚Äôs add the import statements for our components to the top of the file.

  ```js
  import React from "react";
  import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
  import "@patternfly/elements/pf-card/pf-card.js";
  import "./styles.css";
  ```

  Let‚Äôs add some simple markup in the `App` function in the `index.js` file to see that our pf-card is working.

  ```js
  function App() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>PatternFly Elements with React</h1>
        <pf-card>
          <img alt="From https://picsum.photos/" src="https://picsum.photos/id/1019/300/200" />
          <p>This is the light pf-card and <a href="#">a link</a>.</p>
          <p>
            Leverage agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level
            overviews. Iterative approaches to corporate strategy foster collaborative
            thinking to further the overall value proposition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organically grow the holistic world view of disruptive innovation via
            workplace diversity and empowerment.
          </p>
          <a class="cta" slot="footer" href="#">Learn more</a>
        </pf-card>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  Below is the accompanying CodeSandbox to see that our initial setup is correct and that we‚Äôve successfully added our web components to our app.
{% endband %}

{% endband %}

{% band %}
  Now that we have a card and a call-to-action, let‚Äôs add an accordion (pf-accordion) to our app to spice things up a bit.
  If we were building this app locally, we‚Äôd install our dependencies from npm using yarn.

  ```bash
  yarn add @patternfly/elements
  ```

  If you‚Äôre using CodeSandbox, just search for ‚Äú@patternfly/elements‚Äù.

  After installing pf-accordion, add the markup to the `App` function in the `index.js` file.

  ```html
  <pf-accordion>
    <pf-accordion-header>
      <h3>Why do wizards need money if they could just create it?</h3>
    </pf-accordion-header>
    <pf-accordion-panel>
      <p>
        There is legislation that decides what you can conjure and what you can
        not. Because things that you conjure out of thin air will not last, it
        is illegal in the wizarding world.
      </p>
    </pf-accordion-panel>
    <pf-accordion-header>
      <h3>Why doesn't Harry have a portrait of his parents?</h3>
    </pf-accordion-header>
    <pf-accordion-panel>
      <p>
        <a href="#">The characters in the portraits</a> are not actually ghosts.
        They mainly are there just to repeat common phrases or serve as a
        general
        <a href="foobarbaz.com">representation of the individual</a> they
        depict. A portrait of his parents would not be of much help to Harry.
      </p>
    </pf-accordion-panel>
    <pf-accordion-header>
      <h3>Why is Harry considered a half-blood if both of his parents could use magic?</h3>
    </pf-accordion-header>
    <pf-accordion-panel>
      <p>
        Because Harry's grandparents were not able to do magic. This is
        generally frowned upon by those who consider themselves pure, such as
        the Malfoy's or other antagonists.
      </p>
    </pf-accordion-panel>
    <pf-accordion-header>
      <h3>Is Hogwarts the only wizarding school?</h3>
    </pf-accordion-header>
    <pf-accordion-panel>
      <p>
        No! It has been revealed that there are actually 11 long established and
        prestigious schools around the globe. These include Castelobruxo in the
        rainforest of Brazil, Durmstrang Institute (whereas nobody is certain of
        it‚Äôs whereabouts), and Ilvermorny, right here in the United States.
      </p>
    </pf-accordion-panel>
    <pf-accordion-header>
      <h3>Where do the main characters work as adults?</h3>
    </pf-accordion-header>
    <pf-accordion-panel>
      <p>
        Harry and Hermione are at the Ministry: he ends up leading the Auror
        department. Ron helps George at the joke shop and does very well. Ginny
        becomes a professional Quidditch player and then sportswriter for the
        Daily Prophet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a
          href="https://www.pottermore.com/collection/characters"
          target="blank"
          >Read more about the characters</a
        >
      </p>
    </pf-accordion-panel>
  </pf-accordion>
  ```

  And we have to import pf-accordion in `index.js`.

  ```js
  import React from "react";
  import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

  import "@patternfly/elements/pf-card/pf-card.js";
  import "@patternfly/elements/pf-accordion/pf-accordion.js";

  import "./styles.css";
  ```

  Below is the accompanying CodeSandbox for adding pf-accordion to our app.

            sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"></iframe>
{% endband %}

{% band header="Interacting with our web components API" %}
  After adding our accordion, let‚Äôs say that we‚Äôd like to have the first panel of the accordion
  open up after the page loads. To work with the accordion, there are a few things that we need to
  hook up.

  > üëâ **Note**: React 18@experimental provides support for HTML, so the `useEffect`/`useRef`
  > workaround is no longer needed for property setting and event listeners

  First, let‚Äôs import `useRef` and `useEffect`.

  ```js
  import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
  ```

  Now let‚Äôs create a React Ref so we can work with the pf-accordion DOM API. To learn more about
  Refs and the DOM in React,
  [check out their documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html). We‚Äôll start by
  creating a new ref inside our `App` function.

  ```js
  const accordion = useRef();
  ```

  We'll add a `useEffect` callback and call the `toggle` method on the ref's current element
  (our `<pf-accordion>`), so we can open the first panel of the accordion when the page loads.


  ```js
  useEffect(() => {
    accordion.current.toggle(0);
  });
  ```

  Next, let‚Äôs add all of our markup from the `App` function we had previously to our `return` method.
  We‚Äôll also want to add a ref attribute to the opening tag of pf-accordion and set it equal to `{accordion}`.

  ```js
  function App() {
    const accordion = useRef();

    useEffect(() => {
      accordion.current.toggle(0);
    });

    return (
      <div className="App">
        <h1>PatternFly Elements with React</h1>
        <section>
          <pf-card rounded>
            <img alt="From https://picsum.photos/" src="https://picsum.photos/id/1019/300/200" />
            <p>

  Now, when the page loads, the accordion will have the first panel opened. Below is the accompanying CodeSandbox.

{% endband %}

{% band %}
  I realize that may have been a lot. So let‚Äôs recap what we did.

  1. Initial Setup: Added the web component polyfills
  2. Adding PatternFly Elements (web components): Added the following web components as dependencies in our app: pf-card, and pf-accordion
  3. Adding PatternFly Elements (web components): Imported the web components into our `index.js` file
  4. Adding PatternFly Elements (web components): Added the markup for our components in `index.js`
  5. Interacting with our web components API: Created a reference to the accordion so we could open the first panel after the page loads
{% endband %}

{% band header="Wrap up" %}
  So there you have it. We‚Äôve added web components to our React app and gained the benefits of using portable, pre-made components that can also be used in other frameworks like Angular and Vue. If your app is written in Angular or Vue, check out our other two posts: ‚ÄúUsing PatternFly Elements in your Angular App‚Äù and ‚ÄúUsing PatternFly Elements in your Vue App.‚Äù
