{% band header="Color theory" %}
  We've created a palette of abstract color swatches for you to plug in your brand colors. The abstract naming conventions allow you to evolve your colors over time, without trapping your color choices in the code, such as `<pfe-card pfe-color="red">`.

  #### Swatches, per use case (layout and UI)

  - **Base**
      - Choose your most neutral color to go here. Note that some container components (i.e. band and card) will automatically use this color.
  - **Lightest** / **Darker** / **Darkest**
      - Ideally these swatches should build a spectrum of shades from the base color, but you may add more hue if desired. The general intent is that these swatches will be applied to container components, to visually group related content.
  - **Accent**
      - This should be the brightest and boldest color in your palette.
  - **Complement**
      - Choose a softer, secondary color which can also be used to draw attention or convey state change.
{% endband %}

{% band header="UI Colors" %}
  User interface colors are meant to provide basic colors for other page elements besides links and body text. The color is used to convey:

   - **Feedback**: Error and success states
   - **Information**: Charts, graphs, and wayfinding elements
   - **Hierarchy**: Showing structured order through color and typography

  We've exposed 2 UI color variants for the UI elements in the design system to represent your brand:

   - Base
   - Accent

  These colors are used throughout PatternFly Elements. **Accent** is the color which should stand out the most. For example, if your brand colors are orange and gray, we recommend you set orange as the accent color.  In doing this, that orange will now appear on primary level call-to-action buttons and other elements that need to have more weight in the visual hierarchy of the page.

  If you are overriding these colors, you can do so by setting the CSS variables to have new values in the stylesheet of your page or app. You'll want to override the color itself, but also the corresponding hover variant and text color (that would be used if there was text on top of this color, like a button):

  ```css
  :root {
    --pfe-color--ui-base:               #030070;
    --pfe-color--ui-base--hover:        #010047;
    --pfe-color--ui-base--text:         #ffffff;
    --pfe-color--ui-base--text--hover:  #eeeeee;
  }
  ```
{% endband %}

{% band header="Surface Colors" %}
  It's also a good idea to choose some neutral colors for general UI backgrounds and borders—usually grays. Surface color encompass any "surface" that are typically part of container-type elements, like cards or bands. These colors should be harmonious with your corporate style guide (if you have one), but they may not necessarily be your company’s primary brand colors.

  We've exposed 7 color variants for this design system to represent your brand:

  - Lightest
  - Base
  - Darker
  - Darkest
  - Complement
  - Accent
{% endband %}


{% band level=3, header="Contextually aware content" %}
  Text and links, being fundamental pieces of any web property, have their own set of variables. These variables assume a light background by default, assigning typography colors that pass accessibility when placed on white or very light gray contexts. In addition, we provide contextual variables for these typographical elements for when they exist inside a dark or saturated context. Text in a black card for example would need to flip to white to pass accessibility standards while links on a blue or red shade would need to update to white in order to be visible.

  You can set the value of these typography color variables to something in your brand palette but be sure to validate them against a [contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure they continue to pass accessibility standards when set against your surface or UI palettes. Aim for AAA status if you can! ⭐

  Here are a few examples:

  ```css
  --pfe-theme--color--text: #151515;
  --pfe-theme--color--text--on-saturated: #eee;
  --pfe-theme--color--link: #0066cc;
  --pfe-theme--color--link--hover: #004080;
  --pfe-theme--color--link--focus--on-dark: #2b9af3;
  --pfe-theme--color--link--visited--on-saturated: #ffffff;
  ```

  Often components will make decisions about how to best utilize those colors, which is “baked in”. For example, a standard CTA, or [call-to-action component](/components/call-to-action), uses the standard link color in its default state. But, if you set the `priority` attribute value to `primary`, the CTA will make use of the accent color from the palette. Note the correlation here between the priority level of the CTA and the color choice. Because the priority level of primary means that this is the most prominent call-to-action in the viewport, it uses the bright, attention-grabbing accent color. The CTA type "secondary" and the default CTA command less attention.

  <pfe-cta>
    <a href="#">Call to action link</a>
  </pfe-cta>

  <pfe-cta pfe-priority="primary">
    <a href="#">Call to action link (Type: Primary)</a>
  </pfe-cta>

  ```html
  <pfe-cta>
    <a href="#">Call to action link</a>
  </pfe-cta>

  <pfe-cta pfe-priority="primary">
    <a href="#">Call to action link (Type: Primary)</a>
  </pfe-cta>
  ```

  All components automatically observe and react to the attribute `on` which can equal 1 of 3 possible contexts:

  - `light`
  - `dark`
  - `saturated`

  If needed, you can override the `on` attribute by manually applying the `pfe-theme` attribute with one of the following values: light, dark, saturated.

  - `light`
  - `dark`
  - `saturated`

  For example:

  ```html
  <pfe-card style="background: black;" pfe-theme="dark">
      <p>hello world</p>
  </pfe-card>
  ```

  You may notice that when you place a color attribute on a layout component such as the `<pfe-card>`, the attribute `on` also appears when the component upgrades. The value of the `on` attribute is derived from the theme variable that accompanies the surface color. If you deviate from the general convention of the original color and you need the text to change to light, dark, or desaturated, you can also change the theme along with it. For example:

  ```css
  --pfe-theme--color--surface--accent: lightyellow;
  --pfe-theme--color--surface--accent--theme: light;

  --pfe-theme--color--surface--base: navy;
  --pfe-theme--color--surface--accent--theme: saturated;
  ```
{% endband %}
