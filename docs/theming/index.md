{% band header="Overview" %}
  Every PatternFly Element is built to automatically utilize the colors, fonts, spacing, and more defined in the [palette](/theming/palette), which you control! Generally speaking, the only thing you will need to do is re-define some of the CSS variables to match your brand and youâ€™re done.

  For this purpose, we've created a palette of CSS custom properties for you to override with your preferences on typography, color, spacing and more. Many of the components have basic theming options such as `type` or `variant` which will utilize these colors in some way. But beyond that, you may also apply a `color` attribute if you choose to add further customizations to individual components.

{% band header="Context" %}
  In addition, each "content" component comes equipped to adjust its colors depending on where its placed on the page. For example, should you need to put a default call-to-action link (which is a blue) on a dark blue card, the color of the text will need to adapt. This happens via a behind-the-scenes custom property and attribute combo, which inform the component of the current context (on a saturated background) by giving the on attribute the value of saturated.
