> ### Conveying meaning to assistive technologies
> Using color to add meaning only provides a visual indication, which will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies â€“ such as screen readers. Ensure that
> information denoted by the color is either obvious from the content itself (e.g. the visible text), or is included through alternative means, such as additional text 
> hidden with the a class.


```html
<pf-label color="red">
 Some text <span class="visually-hidden-class">Some additional info</span>
</pf-label>
```
