    A couple of years ago the Computer Science Club at Bishop's University
    ran into a problem. Our student run computer lab was running
    unlicensed copies of a propriety operating system. The computers also
    had many unlicensed programs installed. It was a big mess. At that
    time we had to make an ethical decision. We had to decide whether we
    wanted to continue breaking the law or not. We decided against running
    software for which we didn't have licenses as it could lead to the lab
    being closed.
    </p>

    <p>
    Once that was settled we were left with another decision. We could
    either do fund raising and purchase propriety software legally or use
    a Free software system like GNU/Linux which is usually available at no
    cost. After calculating the expense of purchasing propriety software
    licenses for 6 workstations we came to the realization that we just
    didn't have $2,000+ to spend on software when a no cost solution was
    available.
    </p>

    <p>
    Switching all of the systems over to GNU/Linux was one of the best
    things that we've ever done. Besides having a legal lab, we also got a
    lot of advanced features that the proprietary software we were using
    lacked. We can update all of the machines from one location. We can
    easily share a printer and configure the software to limit its usage
    so that no one particular user can use up all of our toner.
    Centralized logins and home directories mean that you can sit down at
    any of our 6 workstations and have access to all of your files and
    program settings. Free software does everything that we need.
    </p>

    <p>
    While there were a lot of tangible benefits, switching to Free
    Software also has some non-tangible benefits. If someone new comes
    into the lab and likes what they see, we have the freedom to be good
    neighbors and share copies of the software. Being friendly and sharing
    helps society. We are also free to browse and modify the source code
    for the programs that we run. Being able to read  large, complete,
    well written computer code gives us a chance to learn from others. It
    also gives us another level of customization that proprietary software
    just can't offer.

    Free software is absolutely critical to the way I perform daily
    computer tasks.  In particular, I have grown accustomed to the high
    level of configurability and the degree of interoperability found in
    free software.  With free software, I find that I get the benefits one
    might see when using solutions from a single large software vendor
    (consistency in installation and configuration, interoperability,
    etc.) without any of the drawbacks (vendor "lock-in" chief among
    them).  Of course, free software isn't developed by a single vendor;
    these benefits arise from the openness of free software, and I find
    this openness very refreshing.
    </p>

    <p>
    In my academic research in computer science, I use free software
    almost exclusively.  I find that it is necessary in my compiler,
    middleware, and operating systems research to be able to study and
    tinker with the internals of existing systems and yet be free to
    openly publish my conclusions.  This is often not possible or
    permitted with proprietary offerings.  I often release products of my
    research as free software, to allow others the same capacity to study
    my work.
    </p>

    <p>
    In my experience, free software does precisely what technology is
    supposed to do: it enables me to perform tasks.  Non-free software
    doesn't always rise to this definition of "technology."  Proprietary
    data formats can and do lock away data.  Proprietary software can give
    nasty surprises when it decides incorrectly that you're manipulating
    data improperly (as, for example, when it suspects you of copyright
    infringement, even when your actions are legitimate and legal).  Such
    software turns technology on its head: it disables you rather than
    enabling you.  I have not the patience to fight with technology; I
    need it to be on my side.
