    Free software is absolutely critical to the way I perform daily
    computer tasks.  In particular, I have grown accustomed to the high
    level of configurability and the degree of interoperability found in
    free software.  With free software, I find that I get the benefits one
    might see when using solutions from a single large software vendor
    (consistency in installation and configuration, interoperability,
    etc.) without any of the drawbacks (vendor "lock-in" chief among
    them).  Of course, free software isn't developed by a single vendor;
    these benefits arise from the openness of free software, and I find
    this openness very refreshing.

    In my academic research in computer science, I use free software
    almost exclusively.  I find that it is necessary in my compiler,
    middleware, and operating systems research to be able to study and
    tinker with the internals of existing systems and yet be free to
    openly publish my conclusions.  This is often not possible or
    permitted with proprietary offerings.  I often release products of my
    research as free software, to allow others the same capacity to study
    my work.

    In my experience, free software does precisely what technology is
    supposed to do: it enables me to perform tasks.  Non-free software
    doesn't always rise to this definition of "technology."  Proprietary
    data formats can and do lock away data.  Proprietary software can give
    nasty surprises when it decides incorrectly that you're manipulating
    data improperly (as, for example, when it suspects you of copyright
    infringement, even when your actions are legitimate and legal).  Such
    software turns technology on its head: it disables you rather than
    enabling you.  I have not the patience to fight with technology; I
    need it to be on my side.
