# Search Input
A search input lets users type in words to find specific items or information. As they type, it can show matching results to help them quickly find what they are looking for.

## Usage
A search input consists of a text field where users can type to find specific content or items. Unlike selects or dropdowns, which offer predefined options, a search input lets users enter their own keywords to filter or locate results. It includes a clear (Ã—) button to easily remove the current input, allowing users to start a new search quickly.
