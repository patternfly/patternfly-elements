# Tile
A **tile** component is a form of selection that can be used in place of a radio 
button and is commonly used in forms. A tile appears visually similar to a 
selectable card. However, tiles are used specifically when the user is selecting 
a static option, whereas a selectable card triggers an action or opens a 
quickstart or sidebar to provide additional information.

```html
<pf-tile>
  <h3 slot="title">Default</h3>
</pf-tile>
```
