    `npm run test`

## Build

    `npm run build`

## Demo

## Code style

Jump links (and all PFElements) use [Prettier][prettier] to auto-format JS and JSON. The style rules get applied when you commit a change. If you choose to, you can [integrate your editor][prettier-ed] with Prettier to have the style rules applied on every save.
