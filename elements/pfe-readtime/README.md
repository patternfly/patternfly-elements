# PatternFly Element | Readtime element
This component takes in the word count of a given section and does a calculation on that number to return an estimated read time based on language.  The words-per-minute values were sourced from [this article](https://irisreading.com/average-reading-speed-in-various-languages) with the data originating from [this research](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2166061).  For more information, see the [Readtime calculation information](#readtime-calculation-information) below.

## Usage

```html
    <pfe-readtime for="#readtime1" hidden>%t-minute readtime</pfe-readtime>
```

### Accessibility
This component functions purely as inline-content and does not require any focus state.  Should be read by screen-readers inline with it's contextual content.

## Attributes

- `word-count`:  Is the data-attribute you will leverage for readtime. Example: word-count="2500" will let the component know that there is 2500 words in that section and it will do it's calculations based on that number. If you don't want to/have a data-attribute to leverage you can use id="readtime1" and it will get the word count for you.
- `wpm`: Is the attribute used to store the average words per minute readtime for each supported country. For more information on these you can read https://irisreading.com/average-reading-speed-in-various-languages and https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=216606.
- `template`: Rather than use the light DOM region to provide the string template, you can also pass in the value via this attribute. Note that %t will be replaced with the computed readtime.
- `lang`: By default the component will look to the language specified on the html tag but it can also accept an override via this attribute on a component level.
- `for`: Specify the selector of the content you want to capture the word-count from.  Whatever you enter into this attribute will be found using `document.querySelector(<for attribute value>)`.

## Readtime calculation

Average read time by country is determined using the following research: https://irisreading.com/average-reading-speed-in-various-languages

Korean read time research:
https://files.osf.io/v1/resources/xynwg/providers/osfstorage/5cb0b53ff2be3c0016ffe637?action=download&version=1&direct&format=pdf

TLDR:
For Korean, we were able to locate 7 studies in five articles: 5 with silent reading and 2 with reading aloud. Silent reading rate was 226 wpm, reading aloud 133 wpm.

## Code style

Readtime (and all PFElements) use [Prettier][prettier] to auto-format JS and JSON. The style rules get applied when you commit a change. If you choose to, you can [integrate your editor][prettier-ed] with Prettier to have the style rules applied on every save.
